# Code examples for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 

This repository stores code examples and datasets (although you *should not* put datasets into version control!) for the Master's Degree course ["Data Science and Artificial Intelligence"](https://moodle.unimore.it/course/view.php?id=14181) held by [Prof. Stefano Mariani](https://smarianimore.github.io/) for the "Digital Automation Engineering" curriculum provided by the Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
