# Code examples for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 

This repository stores code examples and datasets (although you *should not* put datasets into version control!) for the Master's Degree course ["Data Science and Artificial Intelligence"](https://moodle.unimore.it/course/view.php?id=14181) held by [Prof. Stefano Mariani](https://smarianimore.github.io/) for the "Digital Automation Engineering" curriculum provided by the Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

# Setup

All the following commands (starting after `$>`) assume a **Unix terminal**. If you have Windows...get a Unix terminal ;)

## With git

1. clone the repo `$> git clone https://github.com/smarianimore/teaching_DSAI.git`
2. create Python 3 virtual environment in repo root folder `$> python3 -m venv .venv` (or, replace `.venv` with any name you like)
3. activate virtual env `$> source .venv/bin/activate` (where `.venv` should be the same name chosen in step ยง2)
4. install dependencies `$> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. now you should be good to go

## Without git

1. download repo as zip file
2. unzip the zip file somewhere
3. navigate to the unzipped folder in a terminal
4. install dependencies `$> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. now you should be good to go

# Run code

Each code example can be run as a standalone Python script with no arguments: `$> python3 scripts/example.py` (where `example.py` should be the name of the script you want to run)
